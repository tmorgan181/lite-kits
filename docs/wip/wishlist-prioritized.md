## üî• v0.3 CANDIDATES (Pick from these)

### Quick UX Polish (Easy wins, high impact)

**Priority: HIGH** - Pick 3-4 of these for v0.3:

1. **Preview improvements**
   - [ ] Show kit names as headers in preview
   - [ ] Split files by type (commands, memory, templates, scripts)
   - [ ] Only warn for reinstall if actually overwriting files

2. **Status/validation improvements**
   - [ ] Show installed kit + agent + shell combos (not just kit names)
   - [ ] Better formatting with tables

3. **Removal improvements**
   - [ ] Delete empty folders after removal
   - [ ] Check if files were customized before removing
   - [ ] Option to backup collaboration dir files (--force skips)

4. **Help text polish**
   - [ ] Reorder to mention Copilot first (broader audience)
   - [ ] Clarify `--force` warning (be specific, not vague)
   - [ ] Fix `--banner` help text ("must be first arg")

5. **Logging improvements**
   - [ ] Add `--verbose` details for all commands
   - [ ] Better log density (preview can show counts vs all files)

### Command Improvements

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Pick 1-2 for v0.3:

1. **Git Status Command** (`/status`)
   - Problem: Claude runs 5+ git commands for status checks
   - Solution: Single optimized command with all info
   - Benefit: Faster orientation, fewer tool calls

2. **Audit Command Polish** (`/audit`)
   - Current: Minimal implementation
   - Improve: Better security checks, dependency scanning

3. **Stats Command Polish** (`/stats`)
   - Current: Basic metrics
   - Improve: Code complexity, test coverage, commit stats

### Constitution & Documentation

**Priority: HIGH** - Good for v0.3:

1. **Fill in constitution template**
   - Currently: Generic placeholder
   - Update: Actual lite-kits principles and values

2. **Documentation review**
   - GUIDE.md - Check for accuracy
   - README.md - Ensure PyPI-ready
   - CONTRIBUTING.md - Update for new contributors

## üöÄ FUTURE RELEASES (v0.4+)

### Release Management Commands (v0.4)
**Commands**:
- `/tag` - Create annotated git tag with version selection
- `/release` - Create GitHub release with changelog generation
- Integration with `/audit` and `/stats` for release notes

**Benefit**: Streamline the release process we just went through!

### Spec-Kit Integration (v0.4)
**Features**:
- `lite-kits init` - Launch specify.exe to initialize spec-kit
- `lite-kits spec install/remove/upgrade` - Manage spec-kit installation
- Auto-detection of specify.exe location

**Benefit**: One-stop shop for spec-kit + lite-kits setup

### Script Standardization (v1.0)
**Problem**: Commands rely on agents making many tool calls
**Solution**: Helper scripts for common multi-step operations
**Benefit**: More reliable, faster command execution

## üì¶ BACKLOG (Future considerations)

- Multi-agent workflow improvements
- Better error messages and recovery suggestions
- Installation analytics/telemetry (opt-in)
- Kit templates for custom kits
- Community kit repository
- Quick wins for .claude/CLAUDE.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md templates

## üí≠ NOTES

**v0.2.0 Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Manifest-driven architecture
- ‚úÖ Modular installer (detector, validator, conflict_checker)
- ‚úÖ Kit consolidation (dev-kit)
- ‚úÖ Content-first structure
- ‚úÖ Perfect UX (spacing, previews, help)
- ‚úÖ GitHub release created

**What's Missing for PyPI Confidence**:
- [ ] A few more polish items (v0.3)
- [ ] Constitution filled in (project identity)
- [ ] Final documentation review
- [ ] Manual validation testing

**Philosophy**: Ship early, iterate fast. v0.3 is about confidence, not perfection.
