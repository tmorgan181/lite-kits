## Dev-Kit Commands

The dev-kit provides essential commands for solo development workflows. All commands work in both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot.

### `/orient`

**Quick project orientation for AI agents.**

Provides concise context about the current project:
- Reads project documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- Checks current git state (branch, commits, changes)
- Determines agent role and capabilities
- Summarizes recent activity

**When to use:**
- Starting a new session
- Switching between projects
- After pulling latest changes
- When agent seems unfamiliar with project

**Example:**
```bash
/orient
```

**Output:**
- Project name and description
- Current branch and git status
- Recent commits
- Key files and structure
- Next steps or active work

---

### `/commit`

**Smart commits with staging proposals and conventional commits.**

Creates commits with combined staging and message approval:
- Analyzes changes and proposes staging plan
- Drafts conventional commit message
- Shows both in one prompt for approval
- Supports multi-commit suggestions for large changesets
- Adds agent attribution

**When to use:**
- After making changes you want to commit
- When you need well-formatted commit messages
- For conventional commits with proper formatting

**Example:**
```bash
/commit
```

**Workflow:**
1. Shows staging plan (which files to add)
2. Shows draft commit message
3. Options: approve (y), edit staging (es), edit message (em)
4. Creates commit with attribution

**Commit Message Format:**
```
type(scope): Brief description

Detailed explanation of changes and why they were made.

---

### `/pr`

**Pull request creation with auto-push and smart descriptions.**

Creates pull requests with automatic branch pushing:
- Checks for existing PR (prevents duplicates)
- Pushes branch to remote automatically
- Generates smart description from commits
- Modular scope (only describes commits in THIS PR)

**When to use:**
- When your feature is ready for review
- After completing a set of commits
- To create a PR without manual push

**Example:**
```bash
/pr
```

**Workflow:**
1. Checks if PR already exists
2. Pushes branch to remote (`git push -u`)
3. Analyzes commits since branch diverged from main
4. Generates PR title and description
5. Creates PR using `gh pr create`

**PR Description Format:**
```markdown
## Summary
- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

## Test plan
- [ ] Manual testing step 1
- [ ] Manual testing step 2

- Current branch (won't delete what you're on)
- Base branch (main/master protected)
- Unmerged branches (prevents data loss)

**When to use:**
- After PR is merged
- To clean up stale local branches
- Regular housekeeping

**Example:**
```bash
/cleanup
```

**Options:**
- Default: Delete local branches only
- `--remote`: Also delete from remote

**Safety Features:**

---

### Collaboration Structure

Multiagent-kit adds collaboration directories:

```
specs/NNN-feature/collaboration/
â”œâ”€â”€ active/              # Current work
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sessions/        # Work session logs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ decisions/       # Handoffs, proposals
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/             # Historical (YYYY-MM/)
â””â”€â”€ results/             # Completed deliverables
```

**Session Logs:**
- Document work sessions
- Track decisions made
- Share context between agents

**Decision Documents:**
- Agent role assignments
- Architecture decisions

### Multi-Agent Workflow

**Scenario: Claude Code (backend) + GitHub Copilot (frontend) building a blog.**

**1. Claude Code: Create spec and plan**
```bash
/specify Build a blog platform with auth
/plan
```

**2. Claude Code: Create handoff document**
```markdown
# specs/002-blog/collaboration/active/decisions/agent-split.md

Agent Roles:
- Claude Code: Backend (API, database, auth)
- GitHub Copilot: Frontend (React, UI, components)

Integration Points:
- REST API at /api/*
- Auth tokens via JWT
- Shared types in /shared/
```

**3. Both agents: Work in parallel with git worktrees**
```bash
# Claude Code
git worktree add ../blog-backend 002-blog
cd ../blog-backend

# GitHub Copilot
git worktree add ../blog-frontend 002-blog
cd ../blog-frontend
```

**4. Both agents: Implement features**
```bash
# Claude: Backend API
/implement

# Copilot: Frontend UI
/implement
```

**5. Both agents: Commit with attribution**
```bash
/commit
# Message includes: via claude-sonnet-4.5 @ claude-code
# Or: via gpt-4 @ github-copilot
```

**6. Check sync status**
```bash
/sync
# Shows: agent activity, collaboration status, recommendations
```

**7. Integration: Test together**
```bash
# Both agents coordinate integration
# Run tests
# Resolve conflicts
```

**8. Create PR**
```bash
/pr
# Creates PR with both agents' work
```

## Architecture

### Manifest-Driven Design

All kit metadata lives in `kits.yaml`:
- Kit definitions (name, description)
- File mappings (commands, memory, templates)
- Agent/shell support
- Installation paths

**Benefits:**
- Zero hardcoded logic
- Easy to add new commands
- Easy to add new agents/shells
- Single source of truth

### Modular Installer

Four focused modules:

**detector.py** - Auto-detection
- Detects AI agents (Claude, Copilot)
- Detects shells (Bash, PowerShell)
- Checks if directory is spec-kit project

**validator.py** - Installation integrity
- Validates kit installation
- Checks file presence and structure
- Verifies collaboration directories

**conflict_checker.py** - Safety
- Checks for file conflicts before installation
- Prevents accidental overwrites
- Shows what would be overwritten

**installer.py** - Main orchestrator
- Coordinates all modules
- Preview-first operations
- Manifest-driven file copying
- No hardcoded kit logic

### Content-First Structure

Files organized by content type, not agent:

```
kits/
â””â”€â”€ dev/
    â””â”€â”€ commands/
        â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commit.md
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orient.md
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pr.md
        â””â”€â”€ .github/
            â”œâ”€â”€ commit.prompt.md
            â”œâ”€â”€ orient.prompt.md
            â””â”€â”€ pr.prompt.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to compare agent implementations
- Clear file organization
- Simple to add new agents (just add file variant)
- No directory duplication

## Tips & Tricks

### Preview Before Installing

Always preview changes before applying:

```bash
# Shows preview and asks for confirmation
lite-kits add

# Skip preview with --force
lite-kits add --force
```

### Override Auto-Detection

Explicitly specify agent or shell:

```bash
# Force Copilot even if Claude is detected
lite-kits add --agent copilot

# Force PowerShell even on Linux
lite-kits add --shell powershell
```

### Check What's Installed

Verify installation:

```bash
# Quick status check
lite-kits status

# Detailed validation
lite-kits validate
```

### Reinstall After Updates

If you update lite-kits:

```bash
# Remove old version
lite-kits remove --all

# Install new version
lite-kits add
```

### Multiple Projects

Install to different directories:

```bash
lite-kits add /path/to/project1
lite-kits add /path/to/project2
```

### Custom Kit Selection

Mix and match kits:

```bash
# Just dev-kit
lite-kits add --kit dev

# Both kits
lite-kits add --kit dev,multiagent
```

### Use Help Command

Get help on any command:

```bash
lite-kits help
lite-kits help add
lite-kits help remove
```

### Agent Attribution

All commits include agent attribution:

```
ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

This helps track which agent made which changes in multi-agent workflows.

### Collaboration Best Practices

For multi-agent work:

1. **Define roles clearly** - Document who does what
2. **Use git worktrees** - Avoid conflicts with parallel work
3. **Sync frequently** - Run `/sync` to check status
4. **Document decisions** - Use collaboration/active/decisions/
5. **Commit often** - Small, attributed commits work best

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem: "Not a spec-kit project"**
```bash
# Initialize spec-kit first
specify init

# Then install lite-kits
lite-kits add
```

**Problem: "No supported AI interface found"**
- Make sure you have Claude Code or GitHub Copilot installed
- Use `--agent` flag to override detection

### Command Issues

**Problem: Commands not showing up**
```bash
# Verify installation
lite-kits status
lite-kits validate

# Reinstall if needed
lite-kits remove --all
lite-kits add
```

**Problem: Wrong agent detected**
```bash
# Force specific agent
lite-kits add --agent copilot
```

### Git Workflow Issues

**Problem: `/pr` fails to push**
- Check git remote is configured: `git remote -v`
- Verify you have push permissions
- Ensure branch is tracked: `git branch -vv`

**Problem: `/cleanup` won't delete branch**
- Branch might not be fully merged
- Check with: `git branch --merged`
- Force delete if needed: `git branch -D branch-name`
