- Consistent kit naming across 26 files

### Fixed

**Critical:**
- Command audit found and fixed 26 files with outdated kit names

### Release Notes

This polish release makes lite-kits PyPI-ready with improved error messages, clearer documentation, and verified command accuracy. All user-facing text has been audited for consistency and clarity.

**Key improvements for new users:**
- Installation flow is crystal clear (prerequisites â†’ install â†’ use)
- Error messages guide users through setup (not just "something's wrong")
- Commands are accurate and tested (no broken cross-references)

Ready for PyPI! ðŸš€

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-10

**Major Release: Manifest-Driven Architecture & UX Polish**

This release represents a complete rewrite of lite-kits with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and professional UX.

### Added

**Core Features:**
- Manifest-driven installer (kits.yaml as single source of truth)
- Modular installer architecture (detector, validator, conflict_checker, installer)
- Content-first kit structure (easy to add new agents/shells/commands)
- Preview-first operations (always show changes before applying)
- Smart auto-detection (agents and shells with explicit override flags)
- Conflict checking before installation

**UX Improvements:**
- File count summaries in previews ("Total files to install: 14")
- `help` command that accepts optional command argument (`lite-kits help add`)
- Perfect terminal spacing (leading/trailing newlines on all commands)
- Useful help description (shows quick start instead of repeating tagline)
- `--force` flag for remove command (skip preview and confirmations)
- Banner works with all commands via `--banner` flag (not just standalone)

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive manifest schema documentation (docs/manifest-schema.md)
- Installer design documents
- Human validation test results

### Changed

**Kit Structure:**
- Consolidated project-kit + git-kit â†’ **dev-kit** (all solo development commands)
- New file layout: `kits/{kit-name}/commands/{command-name}.{agent}.md`
- Removed agent/shell subdirectories in favor of file extensions
- Single manifest defines all kit metadata and file mappings

**Commands:**
- `/orient` - Now in dev-kit (was project-kit)
- `/commit` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/pr` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/review` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/cleanup` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/audit` - Now in dev-kit (was project-kit)
- `/stats` - Now in dev-kit (was project-kit)
- `/sync` - Remains in multiagent-kit

**CLI:**
- Help description changed from tagline to actionable quick start
- Improved preview formatting (cleaner, more professional)
- Better error messages and validation
- Consistent `--force` behavior across add and remove

### Fixed

**Critical Bugs:**
- #1: Preview not showing before installation
- #3: Preview confirmation flow issues
- #4: Empty sections showing in preview
- #6: Wrong kits shown in status command
- #7: Duplicate banner in help output

**Other Fixes:**
- Preview confirmation flow (don't skip when user confirms reinstall)
- Duplicate tagline in help output when using `--banner`
- Banner callback logic cleaned up
- Windows console Unicode handling (graceful fallback)

### Architecture

**New Modular Design:**
- `detector.py` - Auto-detect agents, shells, and project type
- `validator.py` - Validate kit installation and integrity
- `conflict_checker.py` - Check for file conflicts before installation
- `installer.py` - Main orchestrator (manifest-driven, no hardcoded logic)
- `manifest.py` - YAML manifest parser and query interface

**Benefits:**
- Zero hardcoded kit IDs or file paths
- Easy to add new commands (just add file + manifest entry)
- Easy to add new agents/shells (just add file variant)
- Separation of concerns (each module has single responsibility)
- Better error handling and validation

### Removed

- Old monolithic installer with hardcoded kit logic
- Separate project-kit and git-kit (consolidated into dev-kit)
- Agent-specific subdirectories (claude/, github/)
- Duplicate files in root (.github/prompts/, .specify/)
- Installer prototype files (installer_old.py, installer_v2.py)

- Professional UV-inspired CLI patterns

**Global Options:**

- `--verbose` / `-v` - Extra output
- `--directory` - Set working directory

**Professional Output:**

### Changed

- Improved flag consistency
- Better help text and descriptions

### Fixed

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-07

**Initial Release: Foundation**

### Added

**Core Features:**
- Package structure with clean architecture
- Kit-based modular design
- CLI with kit and package management

**Kits:**
- **git-kit**: `/commit`, `/pr`, `/cleanup` commands
- **project-kit**: `/orient`, `/audit`, `/stats`, `/review` commands
- **multiagent-kit**: `/sync` command, collaboration structure, memory guides

**Cross-Platform Support:**
- Bash scripts for Linux/macOS
- PowerShell scripts for Windows
- Both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot support

**Installation:**
- Proper pip/uv tool installation
- No shell profile modifications
- Safe add/remove operations

### Philosophy

**Enhance, Don't Replace:**
- Add-on for vanilla spec-kit (not a fork)
- Get upstream updates automatically
- Modular kits (add/remove as needed)
- No file replacements (only adds new files)

## Release Notes

### v0.2.0 Highlights

This is the biggest release yet! We've completely rewritten the installer architecture to be:
- **Manifest-driven**: All kit metadata in one place (kits.yaml)
- **Modular**: Clean separation of concerns across 4 focused modules
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new commands, agents, shells, and content types
- **Professional**: Perfect UX with proper spacing, file counts, and help system

The kit consolidation (project + git â†’ dev) makes lite-kits simpler to understand and use, while the content-first structure makes it easier for contributors to add new features.

### Migration from v0.1.x to v0.2.0

If you have v0.1.x installed:

```bash
# Remove old kits
lite-kits remove --all

# Upgrade package
pip install --upgrade lite-kits

# Add new dev-kit (replaces project + git)
lite-kits add --recommended
```

The dev-kit includes all commands from the old project-kit and git-kit, so you won't lose any functionality.
