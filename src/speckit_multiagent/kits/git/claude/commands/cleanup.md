# Branch Cleanup

**Purpose**: Safely delete local branches that have been merged, keeping your workspace clean.

## Prerequisites

- Git repository
- On a safe branch (not the branch you want to delete)

## Execution Steps

### 1. Get Current Branch and Base Branch

```bash
# Get current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Determine base branch (develop or main)
for base in develop main master; do
  if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/$base; then
    BASE_BRANCH=$base
    break
  fi
done

echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
echo "Base branch: $BASE_BRANCH"
```

**Safety check**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Currently on: dev/004-cleanup-command

Cleanup will check branches merged into: develop

Continue? (y/n): _____
```

### 2. Find Merged Branches

```bash
# Get all merged branches (excluding current, base, and protected branches)
git branch --merged $BASE_BRANCH | \
  grep -v "^\*" | \
  grep -v "$BASE_BRANCH" | \
  grep -v "main" | \
  grep -v "master" | \
  grep -v "develop"
```

**If no merged branches found**:
```
‚úì No merged branches to clean up.

All branches are either:
  - Currently active
  - Protected (main/develop/master)
  - Unmerged

Workspace is clean!
```

**If merged branches found**, analyze each:
```bash
# For each merged branch, get last commit info
for branch in $MERGED_BRANCHES; do
  LAST_COMMIT=$(git log -1 --format="%ar by %an" $branch)
  LAST_HASH=$(git log -1 --format="%h" $branch)
  echo "$branch | $LAST_HASH | $LAST_COMMIT"
done
```

### 3. Present Branches for Cleanup

Show branches in a code block with clear formatting:

```
**üßπ Merged Branches Available for Cleanup:**

**Base branch:** develop

**Merged branches:**

1. dev/001-starter-kits
   Last commit: 5b1ad35 (2 days ago by tmorgan181)

2. dev/002-installer-polish
   Last commit: 9cd3690 (1 day ago by tmorgan181)

3. feature/old-experiment
   Last commit: abc1234 (2 weeks ago by tmorgan181)

**Protected branches** (will NOT be deleted):
  - develop
  - main
  - dev/004-cleanup-command (current)

===========================================================
```

**Ask for confirmation**:
- **y** - Delete all listed branches
- **n** - Cancel cleanup
- **e** - Select specific branches (reply with numbers: e.g., "1 3")

### 4. Execute Cleanup

**If user selects specific branches (e.g., "1 3")**:
```bash
# Parse selection
SELECTED="1 3"

# Delete selected branches
for num in $SELECTED; do
  # Get branch name from list
  BRANCH=$(echo "$MERGED_BRANCHES" | sed -n "${num}p")

  git branch -d $BRANCH

  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úì Deleted: $BRANCH"
  else
    echo "‚úó Failed to delete: $BRANCH"
  fi
done
```

**If user confirms all (y)**:
```bash
# Delete all merged branches
for branch in $MERGED_BRANCHES; do
  git branch -d $branch

  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úì Deleted: $branch"
  else
    echo "‚úó Failed to delete: $branch"
  fi
done
```

### 5. Show Summary

After cleanup, show what was done:

```
===========================================================
‚úì Cleanup Complete
===========================================================

**Deleted branches:**
  ‚úì dev/001-starter-kits
  ‚úì dev/002-installer-polish

**Kept branches:**
  - develop (protected)
  - main (protected)
  - dev/004-cleanup-command (current)
  - feature/in-progress (unmerged)

**Workspace status:**
  - 2 branches deleted
  - 4 branches remaining

===========================================================
```

## Important Notes

**Safety Features**:
- Never deletes current branch
- Never deletes base branches (main, develop, master)
- Only deletes branches that are fully merged
- Uses `git branch -d` (safe delete, will fail if unmerged changes)
- Always asks for confirmation before deletion

**Protected Branches** (never deleted):
- Current branch (wherever you are)
- `main`, `master`, `develop` (common base branches)
- Any branch that hasn't been merged

**Error Handling**:
```bash
# If branch has unmerged changes
if git branch -d $branch 2>&1 | grep -q "not fully merged"; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Branch '$branch' has unmerged changes"
  echo "   Use 'git branch -D $branch' to force delete (destructive!)"
  echo "   Skipping..."
fi
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# User: /cleanup

# Agent checks current state
$ git branch --show-current
dev/004-cleanup-command

# Agent finds merged branches
$ git branch --merged develop
  dev/001-starter-kits
  dev/002-installer-polish
  dev/003-git-kit-enhancements

# Agent presents options
Merged branches available for cleanup:
1. dev/001-starter-kits (2 days ago)
2. dev/002-installer-polish (1 day ago)
3. dev/003-git-kit-enhancements (2 hours ago)

Delete which branches? (y/n/e): e

# User selects
Selection: 1 2

# Agent deletes
$ git branch -d dev/001-starter-kits
Deleted branch dev/001-starter-kits (was 5b1ad35)

$ git branch -d dev/002-installer-polish
Deleted branch dev/002-installer-polish (was 9cd3690)

‚úì Cleanup complete: 2 branches deleted
```

## Advanced Options

**Check remote tracking**:
```bash
# Show if branch still exists on remote
for branch in $MERGED_BRANCHES; do
  REMOTE=$(git config branch.$branch.remote 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$REMOTE" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Branch '$branch' still has remote: $REMOTE"
    echo "   Consider: git push origin --delete $branch"
  fi
done
```

**Suggest remote cleanup** (informational only, don't execute):
```
üìù Note: Some deleted branches may still exist on remote.

To remove from remote:
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>

Or delete via GitHub/GitLab UI after PR merge.
```

## Multi-Agent Considerations

When working with multiple agents:

1. **Check collaboration status** (if multiagent-kit installed):
   ```bash
   # Don't delete branches with active collaboration
   if [ -d "specs/*/collaboration/active" ]; then
     # Check for active sessions on branches
     echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Multi-agent project detected"
     echo "   Checking for active collaboration..."
   fi
   ```

2. **Warn about shared branches**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Branch 'feature/shared' may be used by other agents.

   Check collaboration status before deleting.
   Safe to delete? (y/n): _____
   ```

3. **Preserve handoff branches**:
   - Branches with recent handoff documents shouldn't be auto-deleted
   - Warn user if collaboration files exist

## When NOT to Use

**Don't use /cleanup for**:
- Deleting unmerged branches (use `git branch -D` manually with caution)
- Deleting remote branches (use `git push origin --delete`)
- Deleting branches with uncommitted work (stash or commit first)
- Cleaning up worktrees (that's a multiagent-kit feature)

**Use /cleanup for**:
- ‚úÖ Removing local branches after PR merge
- ‚úÖ Cleaning up old feature branches
- ‚úÖ Keeping workspace tidy
- ‚úÖ Safe, confirmed deletions only
