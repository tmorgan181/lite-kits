# Smart Commit with Agent Attribution

**Purpose**: Generate conventional commit messages and add agent attribution for multi-agent tracking.

## Execution Steps

Execute the following steps to create a smart commit:

### 1. Validate Full Git Status

**CRITICAL**: Always check the complete git status before committing to avoid missing files!

```bash
# Get complete status - staged, unstaged, and untracked
git status --short
```

**Analyze the output**:
- Lines starting with `M ` or `A ` = Staged files (ready to commit)
- Lines starting with ` M` = Modified but NOT staged
- Lines starting with `??` = Untracked files
- Lines starting with `MM` = Staged AND modified again

**Auto-stage related files**:
If you see unstaged changes that are clearly related to staged changes, automatically stage them:

```bash
# Example logic:
# - If committing src/foo.py and tests/test_foo.py is unstaged â†’ stage it
# - If committing .claude/commands/X.md and src/kits/.../X.md is unstaged â†’ stage it
# - If committing any file and its test is unstaged â†’ stage it

git add <related-files>
```

**Alert user to unstaged changes**:
If there are unstaged or untracked files that might be related:
```
WARNING: Found unstaged/untracked files that might be related:
  M  src/related_file.py
  ?? new_file.py

Do you want to:
  1. Stage ALL changes and include in this commit (git add .)
  2. Stage specific files (specify which)
  3. Continue with only currently staged files
  4. Cancel and let me stage manually
```

**If nothing is staged**:
```
No changes staged for commit.

Unstaged changes found:
  M  src/file1.py
  M  src/file2.py

Do you want to stage all changes? (y/n)
```

### 2. Analyze Changes

Examine the staged changes to determine:

**Change Type** (following Conventional Commits):
- `feat:` New feature or capability
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `refactor:` Code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance (dependencies, config, build)
- `style:` Formatting, whitespace
- `perf:` Performance improvements

**Scope** (optional):
- Identify the main area/component affected
- Examples: `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `cli`, `installer`

**Summary**:
- 1-2 sentences describing what changed
- Focus on the "what" and "why", not the "how"

### 3. Detect Feature Number

**Check for feature number in order of priority**:

1. **From branch name** (highest priority):
```bash
# Get current branch
git branch --show-current

# Extract feature number from patterns like:
# - dev/001-feature-name â†’ 001
# - feature/002-auth â†’ 002
# - 003-bugfix â†’ 003
```

2. **From specs directory** (if branch has no number):
```bash
# Look for specs directory with feature number
ls specs/*/spec.md 2>/dev/null | head -1

# Extract from pattern: specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md â†’ NNN
```

3. **Use component name** (fallback):
- If no feature number found anywhere, use component/scope name
- Examples: `cli`, `installer`, `git`, `multiagent`

**Feature Number Format**:
- Must be 3 digits: `001`, `002`, `042`, etc.
- Branch pattern: `dev/NNN-*`, `feature/NNN-*`, `NNN-*`
- Specs pattern: `specs/NNN-*`

### 4. Generate Commit Message

Create a beautiful, structured commit message with feature number and agent attribution:

```
<type>(NNN): <subject>

## Summary
<Brief 1-2 sentence overview with enthusiasm>

## Changes
- **<file/component>**:
  - <specific change>
  - <specific change>

- **<file/component>**:
  - <specific change>

## <Additional Section if Relevant>
<Context, impacts, visual improvements, etc.>

**Format Rules**:
- Subject: `feat(NNN):` format with feature number
- Use feature number if available, otherwise component name
- Summary: 1-2 sentences, be enthusiastic but genuine
- Changes: Bulleted list grouped by file/component
- Use markdown bold for file names
- Add emoji where appropriate (sparingly)
- Keep professional but friendly tone
- Attribution: Claude Code standard footer

### 5. Present Commit Message

Show the generated message to the user:

```
===============================================================
Suggested Commit Message:
===============================================================

feat(git): Add smart commit with agent attribution

Generates conventional commit messages and adds agent
attribution for multi-agent tracking.

via claude-sonnet-4.5 @ claude-code

===============================================================
Staged files (3):
  M src/speckit_multiagent/cli.py
  M src/speckit_multiagent/installer.py
  A src/speckit_multiagent/kits/git/claude/commands/commit.md
===============================================================
```

### 6. Confirm and Execute

**Ask user**:
- **y** - Proceed with commit
- **n** - Cancel
- **e** - Edit message (allow user to modify)

**If confirmed**:
```bash
git commit -m "<full message including attribution>"
```

**If editing**:
- Allow user to modify the message
- Show updated version
- Ask for confirmation again

### 7. Post-Commit Actions

After successful commit:
```bash
# Show commit hash and summary
git log -1 --oneline

# Show current branch status
git status --short
```

**Suggest next steps**:
- "Commit created. Push with: `git push`"
- If on feature branch: "Ready to create PR? Run `/pr`"
- If collaboration/ exists: "Update session log in specs/*/collaboration/active/sessions/"

## Important Notes

- **Don't commit secrets**: Check for `.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys
- **No commits without user confirmation**: Always show message first
- **Preserve git hooks**: Don't use `--no-verify` unless user explicitly requests
- **Attribution format is fixed**: `via <model> @ <agent>` - don't modify
- **Keep subjects concise**: Max 72 characters for good git log display
- **Use imperative mood**: "Add feature" not "Added feature"

## Error Handling

**No changes staged**:
```
No changes staged for commit.

Run one of these first:
  git add <files>      # Stage specific files
  git add .            # Stage all changes

Or use: git commit -a -m "message"  # Stage and commit tracked files
```

**Commit failed** (e.g., pre-commit hook):
```
Commit failed: [error message]

Check git output above for details.
Fix issues and try again.
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# User: /commit

# Agent checks staged changes
$ git diff --staged
# (shows changes)

# Agent analyzes and generates message
feat(git): Add smart commit with agent attribution

Generates conventional commit messages...

via claude-sonnet-4.5 @ claude-code

# Agent asks for confirmation
Proceed with commit? (y/n/e): y

# Agent executes
$ git commit -m "..."
[dev/001-starter-kits 53dd4ef] feat(git): Add smart commit...
 3 files changed, 142 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)

Commit created: 53dd4ef
Branch: dev/001-starter-kits
Next: git push origin dev/001-starter-kits
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When working with multiple agents:

1. **Attribution tracks who coded what**:
   ```bash
   git log --format="%h %s %b" | grep "via"
   ```
   Shows which agent made which commits

2. **Session logging** (if multiagent-kit installed):
   - Create/update: `specs/*/collaboration/active/sessions/<date>-<agent>.md`
   - Document what you committed and why

3. **Handoff preparation**:
   - Clear commit messages help the next agent understand changes
   - Attribution makes it easy to ask the right agent about their commits
