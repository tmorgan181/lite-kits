description: Create pull request with smart description generation
---

# Create Pull Request

**Purpose**: Generate PR description from commits and create pull request using GitHub CLI.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Current branch pushed to remote
- Git commits on current branch

## Execution Steps

### 1. Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check if gh CLI is available
gh --version

# Check if authenticated
gh auth status

# Check current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Check if branch has remote tracking
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}
```

**If not authenticated**:
```
GitHub CLI not authenticated.

Run: gh auth login
Follow the prompts to authenticate.
```

**If branch not pushed**:
```
Current branch not pushed to remote.

Run: git push -u origin <branch-name>
Then try /pr again.
```

### 1a. Check Existing PR Status

**CRITICAL**: Always check if a PR already exists for this branch before creating a new one!

```bash
# Check for existing PR (open or closed)
EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr list --head $CURRENT_BRANCH --json number,state,url --jq '.[0]')

if [ -n "$EXISTING_PR" ]; then
  PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$EXISTING_PR" | jq -r '.number')
  PR_STATE=$(echo "$EXISTING_PR" | jq -r '.state')
  PR_URL=$(echo "$EXISTING_PR" | jq -r '.url')
fi
```

**If PR exists and is OPEN**:
```
✓ Pull Request #5 already exists for this branch.

State: OPEN
URL: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/5

New commits will automatically appear in the PR.

Options:
  - Push new commits: git push
  - Update PR description: gh pr edit 5 --body "new description"
  - View PR: gh pr view --web

Continue anyway to update PR description? (y/n): _____
```

**If PR exists and is MERGED**:
```
✓ Pull Request #5 for this branch was already MERGED.

URL: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/5

You have new commits since the merge.

Options:
  1. Create NEW PR for additional changes
  2. Switch to develop and create new feature branch
  3. Cancel

Choice (1-3): _____
```

**If PR exists and is CLOSED (not merged)**:
```
⚠️  Pull Request #5 for this branch exists but was CLOSED (not merged).

URL: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/5

Options:
  1. Reopen existing PR: gh pr reopen 5
  2. Create new PR (not recommended - will conflict)
  3. Cancel

Choice (1-3): _____
```

### 2. Determine Base Branch

**Enhanced base branch detection with remote-first priority**:

```bash
# Step 1: Find base branch that exists on REMOTE (preferred)
for base in develop main master; do
  if git ls-remote --heads origin "$base" | grep -q "$base"; then
    BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE=$base
    break
  fi
done

# Step 2: If no remote base found, check LOCAL branches
if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE" ]; then
  for base in develop main master; do
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/$base; then
      BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL=$base
      break
    fi
  done
fi
```

**Present options to user**:

```bash
if [ -n "$BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE" ]; then
  echo "Detected base branches:"
  echo "  Remote: $BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE (exists on origin)"
  if [ -n "$BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL" ] && [ "$BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL" != "$BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE" ]; then
    echo "  Local:  $BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL (not pushed to remote)"
  fi
  echo ""
  echo "Creating PR requires a remote base branch."
  echo ""
  echo "Options:"
  echo "  1. Use existing remote: $BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE"
  if [ "$BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE" = "main" ]; then
    echo "     ⚠️  WARNING: This will PR into your default/production branch"
  fi
  echo "  2. Use custom branch (specify name)"
  echo "  3. Cancel"
  echo ""
  read -p "Your choice (1-3): " -n 1 -r
  echo ""
  
  case $REPLY in
    1)
      BASE_BRANCH=$BASE_BRANCH_REMOTE
      if [ "$BASE_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
        echo "⚠️  WARNING: You're about to create a PR into 'main'"
        echo ""
        echo "This is your default/production branch. Are you sure?"
        echo ""
        echo "  y - Yes, PR into main (use sparingly!)"
        echo "  n - Cancel"
        echo ""
        read -p "Confirm (y/n): " -n 1 -r
        echo ""
        if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
          echo "PR creation cancelled."
          exit 0
        fi
      fi
      ;;
    2)
      read -p "Enter base branch name: " BASE_BRANCH
      # Check if it exists on remote
      if ! git ls-remote --heads origin "$BASE_BRANCH" | grep -q "$BASE_BRANCH"; then
        echo "Branch '$BASE_BRANCH' doesn't exist on remote."
        echo "Create it? (y/n)"
        read -p "" -n 1 -r
        echo ""
        if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
          git push origin "$BASE_BRANCH"
          echo "✓ Pushed $BASE_BRANCH to remote"
        else
          echo "PR creation cancelled."
          exit 0
        fi
      fi
      ;;
    *)
      echo "PR creation cancelled."
      exit 0
      ;;
  esac

elif [ -n "$BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL" ]; then
  echo "Detected base branches:"
  echo "  Local: $BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL (not pushed to remote yet)"
  echo ""
  echo "Options:"
  echo "  1. Push $BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL to remote and use it"
  echo "  2. Use custom branch (specify name)"
  echo "  3. Cancel"
  echo ""
  read -p "Your choice (1-3): " -n 1 -r
  echo ""
  
  case $REPLY in
    1)
      git push -u origin "$BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL"
      echo "✓ Pushed $BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL to origin"
      BASE_BRANCH=$BASE_BRANCH_LOCAL
      ;;
    2)
      read -p "Enter base branch name: " BASE_BRANCH
      ;;
    *)
      echo "PR creation cancelled."
      exit 0
      ;;
  esac

else
  echo "No base branches found (develop, main, or master)."
  echo ""
  read -p "Enter base branch name: " BASE_BRANCH
fi
```

### 3. Analyze Commits Since Base Branch

Once base branch is confirmed, analyze commits:

```bash
# Get commits since divergence
git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --oneline

# Get full commit messages
git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --format="%s%n%b"

# Get file changes
git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD --stat
```

### 4. Detect Multi-Agent Collaboration

Check commit attributions to see if multiple agents contributed:

```bash
# Extract agent attributions from commits
git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --format="%b" | grep "via.*@" || echo "No attributions found"
```

**If multiple agents detected**:
- Note which agents contributed (e.g., "claude-code" and "github-copilot-cli")
- Highlight collaboration in PR description

### 5. Generate PR Description

Create a comprehensive PR description:

**Format**:
```markdown
## Summary

### 8. Confirm and Create PR

**Ask user**:
- **y** - Create PR
- **n** - Cancel
- **e** - Edit title or description

**If confirmed, create PR**:
```bash
# Create PR using gh CLI
gh pr create \
  --base $BASE_BRANCH \
  --title "$PR_TITLE" \
  --body "$PR_DESCRIPTION"
```

### 9. Post-Creation Actions

After PR is created:

```bash
# Get PR number
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

echo "✓ Pull Request created: #$PR_NUM"
echo ""

# Ask about branch auto-delete
echo "Delete branch after merge? (y/n/later)"
read -r DELETE_CHOICE

if [ "$DELETE_CHOICE" = "y" ]; then
  gh pr edit $PR_NUM --delete-branch
  echo "✓ Branch will be auto-deleted after merge"
elif [ "$DELETE_CHOICE" = "later" ]; then
  echo "You can enable this later with:"
  echo "  gh pr edit $PR_NUM --delete-branch"
fi

# Get PR URL
PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url -q .url)

echo "✓ Pull Request created: $PR_URL"

# Show PR number and status
gh pr view
```

**Suggest next steps**:
- "PR created. Add reviewers with: `gh pr edit --add-reviewer <username>`"
- "Mark as draft with: `gh pr ready --undo`"
- "View PR: `gh pr view --web`"

## Important Notes

- **Review before creating**: Always show PR description for user approval
- **Don't auto-merge**: Never create and merge in one step
- **Check CI status**: Mention if there are failing checks
- **Link related issues**: If this closes an issue, add "Closes #123" to description
- **Draft PRs**: For work-in-progress, create as draft: `gh pr create --draft`

## Error Handling

**gh CLI not installed**:
```
GitHub CLI not found.

Install from: https://cli.github.com/

Or create PR manually at:
https://github.com/[owner]/[repo]/compare/[base]...[head]
```

**Not authenticated**:
```
Not authenticated with GitHub.

Run: gh auth login
```

**No commits**:
```
No commits to create PR from.

Current branch is up to date with base branch.
Make some commits first.
```

**PR already exists**:
```
Pull request already exists: #42
https://github.com/[owner]/[repo]/pull/42

Update it with: gh pr edit 42 --body "new description"
```

## Multi-Agent PR Workflow

When multiple agents collaborate:

1. **Detect collaboration**:
   - Check commit attributions for multiple agents
   - Look for collaboration/ directory structure
   - Check for handoff documents

2. **Highlight contributions**:
   ```markdown
   ## Multi-Agent Collaboration
