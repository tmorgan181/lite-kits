**Theme**: Polish + PyPI Confidence
**Goal**: First public PyPI release with solid UX and documentation

## 🎯 FOCUSED SCOPE (6 Features)

Based on dependency audit and wishlist review, here's what we're shipping:

### 1. ✅ Command Audit (30 min) 🆕
**Priority**: Do this FIRST to ensure quality baseline

**Changes**:
- Review all slash command files in `src/lite_kits/kits/*/commands/`
- Ensure minimalist design (no bloat, clear instructions)
- Verify cross-command references are accurate (e.g., /commit → /pr)
- Check for outdated instructions or broken workflows
- Validate script references are correct
- Remove any redundant or confusing content

**Files to review**:
- `src/lite_kits/kits/dev/commands/.claude/*.md` (7 commands)
- `src/lite_kits/kits/dev/commands/.github/*.prompt.md` (7 commands)
- `src/lite_kits/kits/multiagent/commands/.claude/sync.md`
- `src/lite_kits/kits/multiagent/commands/.github/sync.prompt.md`

### 2. ✅ Better Error Messages & CLI Updates (15 min)
**From**: [docs/validation/v0.3.0-dependency-audit.md](../validation/v0.3.0-dependency-audit.md)

**Changes**:
- Update `ERROR_SPEC_KIT_HINT` in CLI to include:
  - How to install Node.js and spec-kit
  - Why spec-kit is REQUIRED
  - Link to spec-kit docs
- Update "Next steps" message to mention:
  - GitHub Copilot first, Claude Code second
  - Works with any compatible AI assistant
  - Commands are just markdown files

**Files to edit**:

### 3. ✅ README Prerequisites Update (15 min)
**From**: Dependency audit recommendations

**Changes**:

  - Add Node.js requirement (for spec-kit)
  - Mark spec-kit as REQUIRED
  - Clarify AI assistant compatibility (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)
  - Add links to all prerequisites
- Update installation flow to be clearer
- Add "AI Assistant Compatibility" section

**Files to edit**:
- `README.md` (prerequisites and installation sections)

### 4. ✅ Preview Kit Headers (15 min)
**From**: Wishlist UX improvements

**Changes**:
- Show kit names as headers in preview output
- Makes it clear which kit each file belongs to
- Better visual organization

**Files to edit**:
- `src/lite_kits/core/installer.py` (preview formatting)

### 5. ✅ Delete Empty Folders on Removal (20 min)
**From**: Wishlist removal improvements

**Changes**:
- After removing kit files, check if directories are empty
- Remove empty `.claude/commands/`, `.github/prompts/`, etc.
- Clean slate for reinstall

**Files to edit**:
- `src/lite_kits/cli.py` (remove command logic)

### 6. ✅ Constitution Template (20 min)
**From**: Wishlist documentation

**Changes**:
- Fill in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` template
- Add actual lite-kits principles:
  - Cross-agent compatibility

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- Feature 1 (Command audit): 30 min
- Feature 2 (Error messages): 15 min
- Feature 3 (README): 15 min
- Feature 4 (Preview headers): 15 min
- Feature 5 (Delete folders): 20 min
- Feature 6 (Constitution): 20 min

**Total implementation**: ~2 hours
**Testing**: 30 min

## 📋 Implementation Order

1. **Command audit first** (ensures quality baseline for all prompts)
2. **Constitution** (establishes project identity)
3. **Error messages + README** (critical for PyPI users)
4. **Preview headers** (nice UX improvement)
5. **Delete empty folders** (cleanup polish)
6. **Test everything manually**
7. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
8. **Bump version + tag + release**
9. **Publish to PyPI!**

## ✅ Success Criteria

Before we ship v0.3.0, verify:

- [ ] All command prompts audited for quality and accuracy
- [ ] Cross-command references verified (e.g., /commit suggests /pr)
- [ ] No outdated or broken workflow instructions
- [ ] Error messages mention Node.js + spec-kit install steps
- [ ] README clearly lists all prerequisites with links
- [ ] README emphasizes GitHub Copilot first (then Claude Code)
- [ ] Preview shows kit names as headers
- [ ] Removal deletes empty directories
- [ ] Constitution has real lite-kits principles
- [ ] All changes tested in example project
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Version bumped to 0.3.0
- [ ] Git tagged v0.3.0
- [ ] GitHub release created
- [ ] Published to PyPI

## 🚫 Out of Scope for v0.3

These are great ideas but NOT for tonight:

- ❌ Checkpoint system (v0.4)
- ❌ Web discovery interface (v0.5)
- ❌ Health check / analytics (v0.5)
- ❌ Hook system (v0.6)
- ❌ Namespace organization (v0.7)
- ❌ Git status optimization
- ❌ Audit/stats polish
- ❌ Help text reordering
- ❌ Verbose logging

**Why?** We want to ship tonight and establish our PyPI presence. These features can come in incremental releases.

## 🎯 What v0.3 Accomplishes

**For Users**:
1. ✅ Clear installation path (prerequisites, dependencies)
2. ✅ Better error messages (actionable guidance)
3. ✅ Polished UX (preview headers, clean removal)
4. ✅ Project identity (constitution)
5. ✅ High-quality command prompts (audited and validated)

**For Us**:
1. ✅ PyPI published (official distribution)
2. ✅ Baseline established (iterate from here)
3. ✅ Unique positioning validated (cross-agent + spec-kit)
4. ✅ Future roadmap clear (v0.4-v1.0 planned)

---

## 📝 Next Steps After v0.3 Ships

**Immediate** (v0.4 - next week):
- Add `/checkpoint` command (safety net for refactoring)
- Add `/tag` and `/release` commands (streamline releases)
- Expand command library (test, security utilities)

**Medium-term** (v0.5-v0.6 - next month):
- Web discovery interface (GitHub Pages)
- Health check and analytics
- Hook system for automation

**Long-term** (v0.7-v1.0 - next quarter):
- Namespace organization
- Multi-agent coordination
- Script standardization

---

## 💭 Philosophy

**v0.3 is about confidence, not perfection.**

We're shipping a solid, well-documented package that establishes lite-kits as the **only cross-agent, Python-native, spec-kit enhancement framework**.

The features we're adding tonight are specifically chosen to:
1. Remove friction for new users (better docs, error messages)
2. Polish the UX (preview, cleanup)
3. Establish project identity (constitution)
4. Ensure command quality (audit all prompts)

Everything else can iterate. Let's ship! 🚀
